# This file holds default settings. In some cases the settings will be valid values and suitable
# for production, such as maximum upload size. In other cases, some settings will be nonsense
# values, such as access keys.
#
# Settings with a default given here can be assumed, in app code,
# to always be set. So `ENV.fetch` can be used and nils don't need to be handled.
#
# To override these defaults in development (e.g. for developing against an API with real credentials)
# use the .env.development.local file, which is git-ignored. To override these settings in production,
# use the .env.production.local file, also git-ignored.

# We default to a port of 8443 in development because ODK Collect can connect to that port over http
# without complaining about security.
